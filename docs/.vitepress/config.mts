// When a doc page links to a source-tree file with a relative path
// escaping the docs directory (e.g. `[build.rs](../build.rs)` or
// `[handler](../src/…/file_handler.rs)`), VitePress rightly flags it
// as a dead link — those files aren't part of the built site. On the
// deployed site the click would 404. Locally in an editor / on
// GitHub, though, those relative paths ARE useful — they let a
// reader jump to the actual source.
//
// This plugin bridges the two: at build time, links whose href
// starts with `../` get rewritten to their equivalent GitHub blob
// URL. Source stays terse and useful in-editor; deployed site links
// resolve on GitHub instead of 404ing.
//
// Same repo the `editLink` already points at + the main branch —
// keep in sync if the canonical repo ever moves.
