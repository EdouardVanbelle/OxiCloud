//! Storage-backend migration as a recoverable-run tenant (Part 2 engine).
//!
//! Iterates `storage.blobs` and copies each byte payload from the SOURCE
//! backend (whatever the app booted with) to the TARGET backend
//! (whatever the current admin storage-settings config describes).
//! Both legacy whole-file blobs AND CDC chunk blobs are covered by the
//! single walk — they share `storage.blobs` as their physical registry
//! (see memory `project_cdc_dual_storage_registries`).
//! `storage.chunk_manifests` is pure PG state, holds no backend bytes,
//! and needs no migration.
//!
//! Retires the in-memory `Arc<RwLock<MigrationState>>` + one-shot
//! `tokio::spawn` in `migration_job.rs`. The recoverable engine
//! provides cursor persistence, cooperative cancel, boot-time crash
//! recovery, and the uniform `/api/admin/jobs/*` admin surface.
//!
//! ### Restart survival
//!
//! Cursor + per-blob failure findings are persisted after every batch.
//! On restart the boot-time sweep flips any abandoned `Running` row to
//! `Paused`; a subsequent admin trigger resumes from the persisted
//! cursor via `run_or_resume`. At most one batch of already-copied
//! blobs replays, and the `target.blob_exists` short-circuit makes
//! even that replay effectively free.
//!
//! ### Design notes
//!
//! * **Cursor.** UTF-8 hex of the last-processed blob hash (64 chars).
//!   Natural lex order matches `ORDER BY hash ASC`. Same encoding
//!   `blobs_consistency` uses.
//! * **Target resolution.** Rebuilt at the START of every fresh or
//!   resumed run via `StorageSettingsService::build_effective_backend`.
//!   Held for the duration of the run; a mid-run settings change is
//!   ignored until the next run. On resume the admin may have paused
//!   *specifically* to fix a broken target config, so we re-derive
//!   rather than pin.
//! * **Per-blob failures don't fail the run.** Each failure records a
//!   `migration_failed` finding (severity `data_loss` — the bytes
//!   didn't cross) and the walk continues. A run that completes with
//!   zero findings is proof the target has every blob.
//! * **Skip already-present blobs.** `target.blob_exists(hash)` before
//!   the copy — makes cheap re-runs safe and lets a paused run resume
//!   without redoing bytes.
//! * **No per-batch concurrency knob.** The old code buffered N copies
//!   in parallel. Sequential is easier to reason about with cooperative
//!   cancel + cursor discipline; the batch loop is I/O-bound anyway.
//!   Add concurrency later if a real throughput need appears.
